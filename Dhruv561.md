# Project Name
Rasberry Pi Dogital Display

## Summary
I will be using a rasberry pi to create and build a digital smart display which I will be able to display information such as time, calendar, weather, events, be able to control smart devices, etc. I really want to build this after watching some two way mirror / magic mirror videos on youtube which display information like this and only being powered by a rasberry pi. The goal is to start with just building a smart display and then turn it into a magic mirror if I have the time and budget. This is also a great use of the spare tv we have in the house.


## Plan

I'll be ordering a rasberry pi 4 off of the official rasberry pi website which will be used to power the smart display. I already have access to a large display due to having a spare tv. I will then use the rasberry pi starter kit snd accesories to wire the tv to the rasberry pi and be able to control it. The accesories kit is very beneficial here as it contains all the wires I would need to possibly use when connecting to the tv. I will then watch some youtube videos and learn how code the rasberry pi to display and sync all of my smart devices and display the vital infirmation I need using youtube videos. Throughout the whole process I will be following videos which ensure that I am building the smart display correctly. This is the intial plan however after this I may on my own purchase a two way mirror and a frame for tv and turn it into a full magic mirror powered by the rasberry pi if I have the time and budget. I would do this by placing the tv into a wooden ikea frame and then placing a two way mirror film on top to create the illusion of a smart mirror.
