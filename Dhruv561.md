# Project Name
Arduino Robots

## Summary

I’m going to be building a robotic hexapod and car which are controlled using an Arduino board that I can have fun building. The goal of this project is to create something that is super cool that I can control using a remote to move. I am also going to build an Arduino controlled smart lamp which I would use in my bedroom.



## Plan

I’ll be ordering an Arduino uno kit off of Amazon which will give me all the tools and equipment needed for building all the projects. Then I will order the robot kits for a hexapod and car which I will assemble and connect and control with the Arduino using the instructions as well as YouTube videos online. For the smart lamp I will be using the Yeelight and putting it in my lamp which will be wired to the Arduino allowing me to control it. I will also be following a YouTube video for this.
I will be using the arduino kit in order to power all of my builds and to control them using code written in the arduino software. The hexapod build kit contains unassembled peices such as frames which I will use to build the shape of the hexapod, its legs, and motors, etc and then powered with the arduino. The car build kit is similar as well as it also contains parts such as frames and wheels which are neccesarry to build it and to be powered by the arduino. As for the light bulb, I will require a smart bulb which is wired to the arduino which will be able to be programmed to control the light bulb.
